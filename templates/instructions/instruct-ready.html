        <p>In this experiment, you will play the role of a research laboratory
        technician examining classifications of gemstones.</p>

        <p>We will ask you to classify eight specimens.</p>

        <p>There is one true classification for each specimen.</p>

        <p>You can make your judgments of the class based on two sources of
        information. One source of information is the laboratory tests you run
        yourself. The second source of information is judgments from previous
        technicians.</p>

        <p>Each test you run yourself will indicate a selection of possible
        classifications the specimen. For example, one test might indicate that
        a specimen is likely one of either the "pesho", "ivil", or "thyun"
        classifications, which are all names of potential classifications. <b>The
        true classification has a 60% chance of appearing in each test, and
        each incorrect classification has a 50% chance of appearing.</b></p>

        <p>As for the second source of information you will have, the set of
        technicians working on this project (i.e., previous MTurk workers)
        operate in shifts. You will be able to observe the judgment of workers
        from the previous shift as long as you are not in the first shift. For
        example, you might see that a technician from the previous round chose
        "pesho" as the correct classification.</p>
